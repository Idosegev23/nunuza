# Nunuza Project Rules

## Critical Language & Target Market Rules
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: ALL development MUST target East African markets with English as primary language**

### Target Markets
- Uganda (primary market)
- Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi

### Language Policy
1. **English** (Primary) - DEFAULT language for ALL interfaces
2. **French** - Secondary for francophone regions  
3. **Swahili** - Regional lingua franca

**üö´ NEVER use Hebrew or any other language in the UI**

### Translation Requirements (MANDATORY)
Every component and feature MUST:
- Use `useTranslation` hook from react-i18next
- Have complete translations in `/src/locales/en/`, `/src/locales/fr/`, `/src/locales/sw/`
- Default to English text
- Follow existing translation patterns

### Code Standards
- TypeScript + Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Development Workflow
1. Always check existing translations before creating new ones
2. Update all three language files when adding new text
3. Use semantic translation keys (e.g., `dashboard.title`, `posts.create`)
4. Test with different languages in development

### Project Context
Nunuza is a marketplace for East Africa connecting buyers/sellers across multiple countries. Focus on local trade, community needs, and mobile-first experience for African markets.

**Remember: This is NOT an Israeli/Hebrew project - it's for East African markets in English/French/Swahili only.**
