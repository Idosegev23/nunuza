# Memory Bank - Nunuza Project Documentation

## üìã Overview
This Memory Bank serves as the central knowledge repository for the Nunuza marketplace project. It provides comprehensive documentation to ensure continuity and context across development sessions.

## üîÑ Update Guidelines

### When to Update
- After implementing significant features
- When architectural decisions are made
- At the end of each development session
- When project requirements change
- When bugs are discovered and fixed

### How to Update
1. **Read First**: Always review existing documentation before starting work
2. **Update Incrementally**: Keep documentation current with code changes
3. **Be Specific**: Include concrete details, not just high-level concepts
4. **Link Related**: Cross-reference between documents when relevant
5. **Version Important**: Note version numbers and dates for critical changes

## üìà Usage Pattern

### Session Start
1. Read `projectbrief.md` to understand project foundation
2. Review `activeContext.md` for current development focus
3. Check `progress.md` for recent achievements and next priorities
4. Reference `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` as needed

### During Development
- Update `activeContext.md` with current decisions and challenges
- Document new patterns in `systemPatterns.md`
- Track progress in `progress.md`

### Session End
- Update `progress.md` with completed work
- Document any new technical decisions
- Update `activeContext.md` with current state
- Note any issues or blockers discovered

## üéØ Key Principles

### Documentation Quality
- **Clarity**: Write for future understanding, not current knowledge
- **Completeness**: Include all necessary context and details
- **Accuracy**: Keep information current and correct
- **Accessibility**: Make information easy to find and understand

### Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep documentation synchronized with code
- **Conflict Resolution**: Address inconsistencies immediately
- **Deprecation**: Mark outdated information clearly
- **Backup**: Maintain version history for critical decisions
